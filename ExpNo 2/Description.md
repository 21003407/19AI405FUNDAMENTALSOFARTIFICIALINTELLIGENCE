<H3>Aim:</H3>
<p>To Implement Breadth First Search Traversal of a Graph using Python 3.</p>
<h3>Theory:</h3>
<p>Breadth-First Traversal (or Search) for a graph is like the Breadth-First Traversal of a tree.
The only catch here is that, unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles so that we may come to the same node again. To avoid processing a node more than once, we divide the vertices into two categories:
<ol><li>Visited</li>
<li>Not Visited</li></ol>
</p>
