GOALS

Improve the decision-making efficiency of the computer player by reducing the number of evaluated nodes in the game tree.
Tic-Tac-Toe game implementation incorporating the Alpha-Beta pruning and the Minimax algorithm with Python Code.
IMPLEMENTATION

The project involves developing a Tic-Tac-Toe game implementation incorporating the Alpha-Beta pruning with the Minimax algorithm. Using this algorithm, the computer player analyzes the game state, evaluates possible moves, and selects the optimal action based on the anticipated outcomes.

The Minimax algorithm

recursively evaluates all possible moves and their potential outcomes, creating a game tree.

Alpha-Beta pruning

Alpha‚ÄìBeta (ùõº‚àíùõΩ) algorithm is actually an improved minimax using a heuristic. It stops evaluating a move when it makes sure that it‚Äôs worse than a previously examined move. Such moves need not to be evaluated further.

When added to a simple minimax algorithm, it gives the same output but cuts off certain branches that can‚Äôt possibly affect the final decision ‚Äî dramatically improving the performance
